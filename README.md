# Weather Assistant 
In this project, we decided to create weather assistant. We will be collecting our data using Raspberry Pi sensors.
# Raspberry Pi Components
We will use the following Raspberry Pi Components:
- Attitiude sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Himidity sensor
- OLED Screen
- RFID Card Reader
- Multiple LEDs
- Buzzer
- and more?
# General Information
- Data will be displayed on website.
- API  used to transefer data will be implemented using python language.
- Users will be able to create account via email and set at what time of the day they want they data collected.
- Our web application will suggest activities based on current weather conditions.
- Users will be able to add card to their account. It enables quick log-in and some extra secret features. (More about them at release!)
- OLED Screen will display some info about user when logged-in using RFID Card.
- LED Animations indicating success or failure of logging-in via RFID Card.
- Website encludes tutorial how to properly connect RFID Card to their account.
- Dashboard and statistics -> NextJs.
- Notifications about suggested activities and potential warnings about the weather via email.
-Data stored in NoSQL Database, because there aren't many relations between data.
- Some additional personalization options.
# Potential future improvements - extra featues
- Smog detector
- Simple face recognition algorithm.
- Logging-in via Face-Id.
